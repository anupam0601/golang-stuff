# Kafka setup in mac
# this will install java 1.8, zookeeper, and kafka
brew install kafka

# this will run ZK and kafka as services
brew services start zookeeper
brew services start kafka



# To edit kafka or zookeeper properties
To have launchd start kafka now and restart at login:
  brew services start kafka
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties & kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
